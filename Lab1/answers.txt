1.) We are not getting the correct value because it is only using value found from
the parent process and thus only half the calculation.

2.) the issue was fixed by using a wait comman in the parent process then getting the child result by shifting by 8 bits. Ie the second 8 bits are the info from the child process

3.) any number n where n is less than or equal to 25 works. This s is because after 25 the second half of the calculation will over flow the 8 bits ie add up to a number the greater than 256 would overflow

4.) n is less than or equal to 45. This is the max value where the bottom half of the calculation doesnt exceed 256 and thus over flow the 8 bits of information from the child node.
