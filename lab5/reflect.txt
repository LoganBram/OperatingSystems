It was found that there were enough frames to hold each page on its own and therefore we only inccured 8 page faults in total due to there being
a page fault every time that a page was loaderd into the frame. The working set was big enough so that each page only neededed to be loaded 
once and then it was already in the frame when it was needed again.
